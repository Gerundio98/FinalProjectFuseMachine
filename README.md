# Prediction of Apple's Stock Value Using Artificial Intelligence

## Members: Rodolfo Peña.

## Justification.
In this project, I tackle the challenging yet fundamental task of predicting the value of Apple's stocks. This endeavor is critical not only because of Apple's significant weight in global markets but also for the opportunity it represents to advance our understanding of stock market dynamics. By integrating economic analytical methods with advanced artificial intelligence algorithms, I aim to unravel and forecast the patterns of stock price fluctuations of one of the world's most influential companies.

## Objectives and Scope.
The project has two primary goals: first, to develop an artificial intelligence model that can accurately predict the value of Apple's stocks in the near future. Second, to identify and examine the economic and market factors that influence these value fluctuations. At the heart of our study lies the question: How can AI algorithms and economic analysis be combined to enhance stock price prediction in a volatile market?

My approach will include both academic analysis, exploring machine learning algorithms and their applicability in finance, and the development of a product-based tool that employs AI models for stock prediction. The complexity of the project lies in the handling and analysis of large datasets and the application of advanced AI techniques. The scope is defined to design, test the prediction model over a set timeframe, and analyze its applicability in investment strategies.

## Datasets.
In my effort to develop a robust and accurate predictive model for Apple's stocks, I have turned to a variety of data sources, each offering a unique and valuable perspective. Apple's stock data obtained from Yahoo Finance is foundational, providing a detailed view of the stock's historical behavior. This dataset allows us to identify patterns and trends in stock prices, which is crucial for any attempt to predict their future movement.

Additionally, Apple's annual financial data gives us an inside perspective on the company's financial health, including revenues, costs, and operating expenses. This information is essential for assessing Apple's financial soundness and stability, factors that directly influence its stock valuation in the market.

Data on Apple's dividends and stock splits also play a crucial role. These reflect significant corporate decisions that can affect market perceptions of the company. Understanding how investors react to these decisions allows us to analyze the impact of shareholder remuneration policy and capital structure changes on stock prices.

Market indices like the Dow Jones and NASDAQ-100 provide valuable context for Apple's stock performance. These indices are indicators of the overall market and help us understand how movements and trends in the broader market can affect individual companies like Apple.

Comparison with key competitors in the tech sector, such as Samsung, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon, is equally important. Analyzing data from these companies allows us to have a comparative and competitive perspective, revealing sectoral factors and market trends that could influence Apple.

Lastly, macroeconomic indicators provided by sources like the World Bank, including CPI, GDP, and unemployment rates, offer an understanding of the economic environment in which Apple operates. These indicators are crucial for understanding the macroeconomic conditions that can have a direct impact on Apple's financial performance and market valuation.

Each of these datasets enriches our understanding of the ecosystem in which Apple operates and plays a vital role in the development of our predictive model, ensuring that we consider both internal company factors and external market and global economic influences.

## Literature Review.
Recent academic literature has extensively investigated the use of machine learning methods in stock market prediction, focusing attention on both technical and fundamental analysis. A notable study is "Effectiveness of Artificial Intelligence in Stock Market Prediction Based on Machine Learning" available on arXiv.org. This study focuses on data pre-processing using financial indicators such as simple moving average, exponential moving average, RSI, and MACD. This process is crucial for building the input features in a machine learning model.

Another significant study is "Machine Learning for Stock Prediction Based on Fundamental Analysis" by Yuxuan Huang et al., which explores three machine learning algorithms - Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN), Random Forest (RF), and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) - for stock prediction based on fundamental analysis. This study, available on arXiv.org, found that the RF model achieved the best prediction results and that RF-based feature selection could enhance the performance of the FNN and ANFIS model tests.

Both studies demonstrate the utility of combining technical and fundamental analysis methods with machine learning techniques to enhance prediction in the stock market. This underscores the relevance of my project, which also seeks to integrate these techniques in predicting the value of Apple's stocks. These findings can provide a solid foundation for my literature review, highlighting both the efficacy and the challenges in applying these advanced technologies in the field of stock market prediction.

## Implementation and Results.
I have utilized Python for data analysis, incorporating libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn. Machine learning techniques were employed to predict stock prices, with the model’s precision assessed through statistical metrics. Data visualization was a key component in juxtaposing the predictions with the actual stock values.

I decided to use a linear regression model because, within the context of economics—my foundational field—it is the most commonly used method. This time, however, I'm applying the advanced tools of Machine Learning within the broad spectrum that encompasses AI, seizing this new technology through the knowledge provided by Fuse Machine.

The final model demonstrated high accuracy, with an R-squared value close to 1, although deviations were observed at some points. The predictions aligned with market trends, underscoring the potential of AI models in stock prediction.
